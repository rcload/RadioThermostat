<h1>Pocket Thermostat</h1>
These web pages are designed to be viewable from the Browser application on an Android phone, including the ability to download and install Pocket Thermostat on the phone.
<h2><a href="why.htm">Introduction</a></h2>

   <h2>How to use Pocket Thermostat</h2>
    Pocket Thermostat has three screens. The Main screen has the Change and Schedule buttons which access the other two screens.

    The Android <i>Back</i> button returns to the Main screen.

<h3><a href="usechange.htm">Change thermostat settings</a></h3>
<h3><a href="useschedule.htm">Edit thermostat schedule</a></h3>
<h2>Download and Install</h2>
<p>Pocket Thermostat is not currently on the Android Market. Radiothermostat.com does not allow charging for such an application without prior permission 
    according to their <a href="http://radiothermostat.com/documents/RTCOA%20API%20Terms%20of%20Use%20033011.pdf">terms of use</a> for their API. 
    (Their lawyers are particularly threatening: "...may render you liable for damages and injunctive relief in a court of law.")</p>
Always use caution installing any application on your Android phone. You should find some assurance that the application does not, for example, 
    share your private data without your consent. In the case of PocketThermostat, this is some supporting information:
    <ul>
    <li>When installing, Pocket Thermostat only requests that you authorize internet access and no other Android privileges.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Install</h2>
    To install this app on your Android phone, you must <ul><li>Use the Android Settings menu, go to Applications, and make "Unknown Sources" 
    checked on to allow installation of non-Market applications.</li>
    <li> Your Android Browser must have Javascript enabled in order to download.</li>
    <li> While running the Browser application on your Android, come back to this page you are reading and then click this button and agree to my terms of use: <p>
<input type="button" onclick="show_confirm()" value="Download Pocket Thermostat" /></p>
</li>
<li>
In the Android Browser, once the download is finished, click its <i>Menu</i> key, choose <b>More</b>, and then <b>Downloads</b>. 
    That brings you this screen: <img height="100%" width="100%" src="BrowserDownload.png"/><br /> or a similar one. 
    Click on PocketThermostat... to install.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have previously configured your thermostat to communicate with radiothermostat.com 
    according to their installation instructions, there is no <i><b>requirement</b></i> to disconnect that 
    connection to their cloud software. However, it is very unlikely you got this far in this document if you 
    wanted to use both Pocket Thermostat and radiothermostat together. 
</p>
<p>I have  obvserved that, while my thermostat is configured to update the radiothermostat.com cloud, it responds to 
    Pocket Thermostat with far more delay than it does when it is disconnected from their cloud. Here is one way to 
    disconnect your thermostat from the radiothermostat cloud:</p>
