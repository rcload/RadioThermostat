<h3>Disconnect from the cloud</h3>
Use a browser (either on your Android or on a desktop machine) to browse to your thermostat's 
    "home" page. This page can be reached by typing in only the IP address without any futher qualification. 
    In my own case, it is http://10.0.0.75. On that page, the thermostat offers a "Cloud URL:" setting, which, by default on my 
    own device, is set to "http://ws.radiothermostat.com/services.svc/StatIn". Delete all the text in that box and then click "Submit". 
    I used the (free) product at <a href="http://www.wireshark.org">http://www.wireshark.org</a> installed on a machine inside my Wi-Fi 
    network to verify that my thermostat no longer attempts to make connections to the radiothermostat website.

<br />In my case, it is also possible to configure my NAT router to forbid my thermostat 
    from making external internet connections, which makes redundantly sure it does not publish 
    its state outside my Wi-Fi network.
