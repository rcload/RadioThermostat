    <title>Pocket Thermostat Security</title>

<h2>Security</h2>
Pocket Thermostat 
    communicates directly with the 3M-50 thermostat using their published API. 
    It does not access the <a href="http://radiothermostat.com">radiothermostat.com</a> website, 
    and you need not have your thermostat registered there for Pocket Thermostat to work. Pocket 
    Thermostat does not provide encryption or any other security. Using it securely depends on your use of it as described below.<br />
    
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>Pocket Thermostat can only communicate with your 
    thermostat if your thermostat's Wi-Fi URL is accessible from your Android phone. 
    If you&#39;re at home then your phone, if its Wi-Fi radio is enabled, can reach your thermostat 
    because both are on the same Wi-Fi network. Your home Wi-Fi installation should use strong encryption on 
    its radio link, which protects your Wi-Fi network, including your thermostat, from snooping. WPA is recommended. 
    WEP is better than no encryption, but there are easily-used published crackers for WEP. 
    
    <p>A typical home Wi-Fi installation has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a> 
    router which, unless you use its adminstrator capabilities to publish the thermostat server on the internet, restricts 
    access to your thermostat to within your home&#39;s LAN (local area network) and forbids access from any source on the 
    internet outside. Because the thermostat itself provides no security, it is strongly recommended that you do <b>not</b> 
    ever use your router to publish your thermostat's web server port 80 on the internet!</p>
    <h3>Encrypting control from the internet</h3>
    This is an advanced topic that is only summarized here. If you have a computer that runs 24 hours per day x 7 days per week, 
    and is inside your NAT router network, and has an openssl server installed and running, you can arrange for encrpyted control 
    from your Android phone from anywhere in the world via the internet. Here is a summary of how to set up such a configuration:
 <ul><li>install an <a href='http://www.openssl.org'>openssl</a> server running 24x7 inside your NAT firewall. I use, for example, 
     an old Dell laptop running a recent version of Ubuntu linux.</li>
     <li>Arrange for your NAT router&#39;s wide-area-network (WAN) IP address, which can change over time, to be published on the 
     world-wide-web such that it can be looked up on the internet. I use the free service at <a href='http://www.no-ip.com'>http://www.no-ip.com.</a></li>
 <li>Configure your home NAT router to forward incoming internet SSL connections on TCP port 22 to your openssl server.</li>
 <li>Install the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/connectbot/">Connect Bot</a> App on your Android phone.</li>
 <li>Use Connect Bot on your phone to login to an account on your openssl machine, and set ConnectBot&#39;s "Port Foward" 
     for some port on your Android phone (I use number 8100, for example) to forward to port 80 on your thermostat's IP address 
     inside your Wi-Fi NAT router. (My thermostat is on 10.0.0.75:80, for example)</li>
     <li>In Pocket Thermostat, specify the forwarded port to connect to your thermostat (http://localhost:8100 in my example). 
     In this configuration, the Pocket Thermostat messages over the internet are encrypted using SSL.</li>
     <li>With all the above in place, Pocket Thermostat on your phone can securely communicate with your thermostat. This is 
     just a summary of an example. There may be other ways to encypt communication from your phone to your within your home router.</li>
 </ul>
