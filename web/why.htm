    <title>Pocket Thermostat Introduction</title>

<body>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Here is a free Android app that can control the model 3M-50 thermostat 
described by its manufacturer here: <a href="http://radiothermostat.com/control.html">http://radiothermostat.com/control.html.</a><p>
    Radiothermostat.com provides a web based interface and Android app to control the thermostat remotely, but decided I really 
    could not use that product for these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://radiothermostat.com">radiothermostat.com</a> system maintains all your thermostat settings on their 
    web server. While I have no reason to believe they fail to practice due diligence with respect to the security of my data, 
    I prefer a software archecture that, whenever my data is outside my control, it is encrypted with strong encryption. 
    (Imagine a burglary ring that cracks radiothermostat.com and remains undetected. They now have real time access to a 
    world-wide database of thermostats that are set to AWAY.)</li>
<li>As of the time I wrote this Android app, the <a href="http://radiothermostat.com">radiothermostat.com</a> Android app 
    had no provision for editing the time and temperature schedule in the 3M-50. Only their web application could edit the 
    thermostat schedule.</li>
<li>The <a href="http://radiothermostat.com">radiothermostat.com</a> software architecture shares the state of your controls 
    between their cloud web server and the device on your wall. This means that there can be race conditions that might lead to this problem: 
<ul><li>I browse to <a href="http://radiothermostat.com">radiothermostat.com</a> and set my mode to HEAT.</li>
<li>Within a minute or two later, I walk to the device on the wall and set it to OFF.</li>
<li>I walk to the furnace and remove the air filter to replace it.</li>
<li>While I have the furnace open, it comes on in HEAT mode. (I really should throw the breaker to change the filter, but, on 
    the other hand, before I added WiFi to my thermostat, this was not necessary.)</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
In addition to their own software package--their website and their Android and other smartphone apps--the manufacturer supplies 
    an API that enables alternative applications: <a href="http://radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced">http://radiothermostat.com/latestnews.html#advanced</a>.
    Pocket Thermostat exploits that API in order to address the three reasons above.
