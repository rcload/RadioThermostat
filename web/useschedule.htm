<h3>Edit Schedule</h3>
    The schedule fits better in landscape mode as shown 
    below, but also can be edited in portrait mode. Wipe the 
    screen left and right to scroll the days of week into view. 
    Here is the sequence Pocket Thermostat is designed to edit: 
    <ul><li>click the "Copy from thermostat" button to retrieve the thermostat's schedule.</li>
    <li> make your edits,</li><li> use the Android <i>Menu</i> button to access the "Copy to thermostat" button.</li> 
        </ul>Note that Pocket Thermostat only attempts to transact to or from the thermostat once per button click. 
    It puts a message on the screen indicating if it fails--which the thermostat often does. Click the button again 
    until the error message goes away.
    <p>The Heating Schedule is copied and edited indepently from the Cooling Schedule.</p>
